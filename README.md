# DashBoard & Blog posts

React Native with typescript:

** Stories Covered in Project: **

1. Problem statement for front end task was for the website page and it has been adopted to a mobile UI with limited screen area.

2. Created a 2-column layout with Expand and Collapsable drawer (with user details and 2 links e.g., Dashboard and Blogs) and a content section. Drawer has to be collapsable to access the main sections.

3. Make an API call to load user details and fill the sidebar user section and display the name in profile.

4. Implement 2 routes (Dashboard and Blogs) to change the content in the content section.

5. On Blogs page, fetch posts data and display a list with the segment of All, Latest and Archieved.

6. In DashboardDetails component, on clicking 'Edit' button will result in loading of selected item details in a form. User can edit the content. After editing the information, user may click on 'Submit' button.
But, clicking on 'Submit' will not save updated data as we do not any Update or PUT API for the edited data.
So, navigation back will result in loading of the old content in dashboard.

7. Unit testing is demonstrated by creation of Dashboard unit test. Same can be expanded to include more components in future, if needed.
